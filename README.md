### PLEASE read before you score :-))

- I made slides with slidify package. When I knit it, html page shows. However, when I tried to publish index.html, it is a blank page on rpubs website. 
- I downloaded index.html, it is also a blank page. 
- To check the slide, you need to download index.Rmd file and knit in in RStudio. 
- Sorry for the inconvenience. If you know the reason, please let me know! Thanks.
